<!--
 To define a mounting, add a "volume" tag with its respective parameters
 as attributes between the start and end tags of this configuration file.

 The main parameters for mounting a CIFS/SMB share are:
	fstype		[Network File System]
	server		[Hostname, FQDN or IP of the File Server]
	path		[Share Name]
	mountpoint	[Mount Point]
	options		[Mounting Options - See: "man mount.cifs"]

 The following attributes control whether the volume is going to get mounted
 once the user logs in. By default, volumes apply to all users:
	user		[Username]
	uid			[UID number or UID range]
	gid			[GID number or GID range]
	pgrp		[Primary Groupname]
	sgrp		[Secundary Groupname]

 The following variables are provided by the program and can be useful within
 attributes and parameters:
	%(USER)			[Username of the user logging in]
	%(DOMAIN_NAME)	[Domain name of the user logging in]
	%(USERUID)		[UID of the user logging in]
	%(USERGID)		[GID of the primary group of the user logging in]
	%(GROUP)		[Groupname for %(USERGID)]


EXAMPLES:

 Mounting the 'public' share:
	<volume fstype="cifs" server="fileserver" path="public" mountpoint="~/public" />

 Mounting the user's network folder:
	<volume fstype="cifs" server="fileserver" path="%(USER)" mountpoint="~/MyNetFolder" />

 Mounting the 'IT$' share for 'ITD' group users:
	<volume sgrp="itd" fstype="cifs" server="fileserver" path="it$" mountpoint="~/IT" />

 Mounting the 'HR' share for users in the 'HRD' group of the 'SAMPLE' trusted domain:
	<volume sgrp="SAMPLE\hrd" fstype="cifs" server="fileserver" path="hr$" mountpoint="~/HR" options="domain=SAMPLE" />

 Mounting the 'cameras' share for users in the 'security' or 'monitors' group of the 'example.com' domain:
	<volume fstype="cifs" server="fileserver" path="cameras" mountpoint="~/cameras" options="domain=example.com">
		<or>
			<sgrp>security</sgrp>
			<sgrp>monitors</sgrp>
		</or>
	</volume>
